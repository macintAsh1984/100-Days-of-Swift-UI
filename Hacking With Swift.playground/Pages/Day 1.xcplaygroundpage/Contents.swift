/*:
## Day 1 - Variables, Constants, Strings Numbers

## Big Takeaways:
 
- Swift has a high preference for constants.
- `CGFloat` is a type from Apple's Core Graphics library. `Doubles` can be passed into `CGFloats`.
- Swift has type safety to prevent a variable's type from accidentally changing.

### Helpful Methods

**Strings**
- `.hasSuffix()`
- `.hasPrefix()`
- `.count`

**Integers**
- `.isMultipleOf()`*/
